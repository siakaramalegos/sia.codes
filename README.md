# sia.codes

Hello, welcome to my personal website. I try to explore new skills (e.g., CSS grid) so please forgive me if something isn't quite perfect.

## Scripts

- `npm start` to run the development server
- `npm run build` to generate a static website build inside the /dist/ folder
- `npm run deploy` to generate a static website build and deploy to the deployment repo (separate from the source code). Also copies the CNAME record before deploying since this website is hosted through Github pages with a custom domain.
